## Good practices

1.  Don't add serverless plugins as dependencies but add them as dev_dependencies
2.  Don't add aws-sdk as dependency, add it in dev-dependency because it is already present in lambda function environment


## Plugins

1. serverless console VS code extension plugin
2. Use serverless IDE plugin
