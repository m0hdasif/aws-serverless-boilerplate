## Setup 

For setting up the development environment, please follow the provided steps. 

### Install aws-cli globally (Optional) 

*Use either method to install awscli*

#### Python package
**Pre-requirements**
*  Python should be installed on your system
*  Pip should be installed.
    ```sh
    pip install awscli 
    ```
*   if you have Python version 3+ installed
      ```sh 
      pip3 install awscli 
      ```

#### Executable file (windows only)
* Download the executable file from [aws official download page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html), execute file and follow on-screen steps to install Aws-cli.

    ##### Note: you may need to add path of the installed program to the environment variable 
    

### Install serverless globally
* Execute following command in your terminal
    ```sh 
    npm install serverless -g
    ```

### Configure AWS Account
Configure the aws account to which resources need to be deployed

#### Pre-conditions
-   You should have an active aws account.
-   You have access key and secret key that are generated by using IAM service.
    
#### Steps
Configure using one of the following options.

- Aws-cli 
  
    ```sh
    aws configure [--profile PROFILE_NAME]
    ``` 
    ###### for default profile, no need to mention profile name. If in case you have more than accesskey then use profile
    Please provide the valid inputs
    1. access key : AccessKey from IAM  
    2. secret key : SecretKey from IAM 
    3. region (Default: `us-east-2`) Choose: `ap-south-1` for `Mumbai,India`
    4. type: json
- Serverless
    ```sh 
    serverless config credentials --provider aws --accesskey <ACCESS_KEY> --secretkey <SECRET_KEY>
    ```
    ###### NOTE: sls: alias of serverless
    You can use any of the `serverless` or `sls` while using command

### Project Creation   
#### Create Project 
* To create a new project in nodejs for provider AWS 
    ```sh 
    sls create --template aws-nodejs --name <projectName>
    ```

    ###### Note: In order to use existing project, skip step for creation of new template
    
#### Use existing project
* Clone the repository.
  ```sh
  git clone <REPO_URL>
  ```
* change to app directory
    ```sh
    cd <APP_ROOT_DIRECTORY>
    ```

#### Install package dependencies
* Install all the dependencies by installing node_modules and dependent packages
    ```sh 
    npm install
    ```

## Development Process
#### Invoke Lambda function 
  *   In AWS server
      ```sh 
      sls invoke -f <functionName>
      ```
  *   In local environment
      ```sh 
      sls invoke local -f <functionName>
      ```
  *   To provide event(input Data for the function)
      ```sh 
      sls invoke -f [functionName] --data <EVENT>
      ```
  *   Syntax for using file as an event for lambda function
      ```sh 
      sls invoke -f [functionName] --path <FILE_PATH>
      ```
      E.g
       
      ```sh 
      serverless invoke local  -f user_list --path src/event.json
      ```

      ###### Note: all FILE_PATH is relative to the serverless.yml file

#### Deployment
*   To deploy whole package
    ```sh 
    sls deploy
    ```
*   To deploy only function
    ```sh 
    sls deploy function -f <functionName> [--stage <STAGE_NAME>]
    ```
    ###### NOTE: It deploys only the lambda functions i.e. changes made in the serverless.yml file will not reflect. 

#### Run API gateway locally
*   Install serverless plugin (serverless-offline)
    1.  Using npm 
        ```sh 
        npm install -D serverless-offline 
        ```
        ###### Installing serverless-offline as dev dependency
    2.  Using serverless*
        ```sh 
        serverless plugin install serverless-offline
        ```
*   Include the plugin into project
        
    ```yaml
    plugins:
        -  serverless-offline
    ```
*   Run your API locally
    ```sh 
    sls offline [--stage <stage>]
    ```

*   For interacting with APIs
    * postman
      * Download [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) and make request
    * curl
       ```sh 
       curl -X <METHOD_NAME> -d <REQUEST_BODY> -H <HEADER> <ENDPOINT>
       ```
       
#### Miscellaneous 
* AWS Profile name can be mentioned in serverless command by providing option (aws-profile) E.g
    ```sh 
    sls deploy [--aws-profile <PROFILE_NAME>]
    ```

## Plugins

### TypeScript in AWS Lambda
* To use typescript in place of default javascript, follow these steps.
    * Install serverless plugin to create and support offline invocation of functions defined in ts
        ```sh 
        npm i -D serverless-plugin-typescript typescript
        ```
    * Install types for node and aws-lambda
        ```sh 
        npm i -D @types/node  @types/aws-lambda
        ```
        
    * Now create typescript configuration
        ```sh 
        tsc --init` 
        ```
      * It will create `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory
        ##### Note: Don't modify outDir and baseDir property in tsconfig.json, else above plugin may not work properly.

### Split(nested) Stacks
* Serverless stacks cannot occupy more than 200 resources, so there is a workaround by having nested stacks. We can have upto 200 nested stacks, each having capacity of 200 resources. Here, we are using `serverless-plugin-split-stacks` to do the same.
    * Install the plugin and add this into plugins array
        ```sh 
        npm i -D serverless-plugin-split-stacks
        ```
    * Add custom Variable in `serverless.yml` file
        ```yaml
        splitStacks: # any one of the parameter should be true,type will take precedence
            perFunction: false # stack for each lambda function
            perType: true # stack for each type like logs, permissions,lambda function 
        ```

### Schedule lambda function locally
* Serverless lambda function can be scheduled with using rate or cron command. Rate of execution does not support less than 1 min. 
    * Install plugin 
        ```sh 
         npm i -D serverless-offline-scheduler
         ```
    * Add `serverless-offline-scheduler` into plugins array in serverless.yml
    * Use either command to schedule:
       1. Using serverless offline
            ```sh 
            serverless offline start
            ```
            ##### Note: 'start' keyword is necessary, otherwise offline server will start but without scheduling functions. (:bug: serverless-offline-scheduler@0.4.0)
       2. Using schedule method
            ```sh 
            serverless schedule
            ```

### Deploy resources to s3 bucket 
* Upload your resources/objects to s3 bucket using `s3deploy` plugin
  * Install plugin and add plugin to serverless.yml
    ```sh 
    npm i -D serverless-s3-deploy
    ```
  * To deploy resources
    ```sh 
    serverless s3deploy
    ```
  * Add configuration variables as custom vars
    ```yml
    assets:
        auto: true  # start uploading object after deployment to all buckets
        targets:
        - bucket: BucketName # Ref: serverless variable can also be used
            files:
            - source: folderPath   # several sources can be provided
    ```

### Maintain Stage related secrets
* To maintain secrets and share encrypted variable without any fear of revealing it in repo. 
  * Install plugin and add the plugin into plugins array
    ```sh 
    npm i -D serverless-secrets-plugin
    ```
  * To encrypt the file to encrypted file
    ```sh 
    serverless encrypt --stage|-s STAGE --password|-p PASSWORD
    ```
  * To decrypt the secret file
    ```sh 
    serverless decrypt --stage|-s STAGE --password|-p PASSWORD
    ```
  * To change the file-path of secrets, add custom variable in `serverless.yml` file (Optional)
    ```yaml
    secretsFilePathPrefix: filePath
    ```
    ###### Note: This method is better than no-encryption, but not recommended. AWS recommends to use AWS-KMS instead of environment variables.
    ##### Note: password used for encryption/decryption : 'asif'

### Support .env file
* To add support for .env file and use them for various staging.
    * Install plugin and add the plugin into plugins array
        ```sh
        npm i -D serverless-dotenv-plugin
        ```
    * Create a .env file and add to .gitignore. Create one example file with `.env.example` name for expected environment variables.
    * We can have separate file for each environment following `.env.{stageName}`. E.g. `.env.dev`
    * To change the file-path for .env files, add custom variable in `serverless.yml` file (Optional)
    ```yaml
        dotenv:
        basePath: environments/ # trailing / is necessary to tell the directory name, else it will look for {basePath}.env file 
    ```
